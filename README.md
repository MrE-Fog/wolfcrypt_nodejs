# wolfCrypt Node.JS support

To link wolfcrypt you need to run `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib` or wherever you have your wolfssl installed:

Verify the .so (shared object) path and version in `binding.gyp`:

```
        'libraries': [
          "/usr/local/lib/libwolfssl.so.34"
        ],
```

## Package Installation

```
npm i wolfcrypt
```

Then require it in your application code

```
const { wolfcrypt, WolfSSLEncryptionStream } = require( 'wolfcrypt' )
```

Examples of how to use this library can be found in the tests directory
